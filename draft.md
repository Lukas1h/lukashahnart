### about

Hey there—I'm Lukas Hahn, a photographer and videographer from the Pacific Northwest.

Since I was a kid, I’ve had a passion for capturing life—mine and others'—in fun, creative ways. When I was 10, I bought my first camera: an old GoPro I used for years to film family moments and make little YouTube videos. I learned photography on my mom’s old camera, telling stories through pictures of the LEGO builds I loved.

Since then, I’ve started taking my hobby more seriously. I’ve worked on all kinds of photo and video projects—from sports and events to interviews, promotional pieces, weddings, and music videos for local artists.
